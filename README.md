# MovieReview NLP using IMDB Dataset

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled with positive or negative sentiment.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and nltk.

## Dataset

The IMDB dataset is a widely used dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. It contains a collection of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The reviews are labeled as positive or negative sentiment.

The dataset can be downloaded from the official IMDB dataset website or accessed through various machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

## Code Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `MovieReview_NLP.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the IMDB dataset in CSV format (`IMDB.csv`).
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `MovieReview_NLP.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code step by step.
5. Modify and experiment with the code as per your requirements.
